\p{A class of [maps](rs-0001) #{L} has the \em{left lifting property} against
(or is \em{left orthogonal to}) a class of maps #{R}, and #{R} has the \em{right
lifting property} (is \em{right orthogonal to}) against #{L}, if they have the
appropriate [weak lifting properties](rs-00AD) and moreover solutions to the
appropriate [lifting problems](rs-00AC) are unique. We write #{L\perp R}.}
