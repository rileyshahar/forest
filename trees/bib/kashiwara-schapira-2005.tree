\p{Categories and sheaves, which emerged in the middle of the last century as an
enrichment for the concepts of sets and functions, appear almost everywhere in
mathematics nowadays.}

\p{This book covers categories, homological algebra and sheaves in a systematic
and exhaustive manner starting from scratch, and continues with full proofs to
an exposition of the most recent results in the literature, and sometimes
beyond.}

\p{The authors present the general theory of categories and functors,
emphasising inductive and projective limits, tensor categories, representable
functors, ind-objects and localization. Then they study homological algebra
including additive, abelian, triangulated categories and also unbounded derived
categories using transfinite induction and accessible objects. Finally, sheaf
theory as well as twisted sheaves and stacks appear in the framework of
Grothendieck topologies.}
