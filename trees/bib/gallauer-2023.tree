\p{
  These are lecture notes for a course delivered through the Taught Courses
  Center (Bath, Bristol, Imperial, Oxford, Warwick) in Fall 2023. The goal is to
  introduce the language of ‚àû-categories (as quasi-categories), hopefully enabling
  the audience to tackle more ad- vanced texts and read some of the literature
  employing this language. Many proofs are omitted, some of which are difficult
  and would require developing substantial extra ma- terial. On the other hand,
  this omission allows us to talk about a number of subjects, including
  constructing ‚àû-categories, (co)limits and presentability. We end with spectra
  and the ùêæ-theory of stable ‚àû-categories.
