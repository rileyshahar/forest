\p{The \em{ring of integers} #{\ZZ} is the [initial](rs-0021) [ring](rs-00B6).
Explicitly, their underlying set is the [integers](rs-00BA), with the ordinary
multiplication and addition.}

\proof{
  \p{Given a ring #{R}, a map #{\ZZ\to R} must send #{1} to the multiplicative
  unit of #{\RR}, and since #{\ZZ} is generated by #{1} this forces the rest of
  the map.}
