\p{We introduce Lawvere theories and then discuss Bohmann-Szymik's work on their
K-theory. From the K-theoretic perspective, Lawvere theories are a convenient
generalization of rings in which Quillen's +=Q theorem still holds, enabling a
more computationally tractable K-theory than more general settings.}
