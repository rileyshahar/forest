\p{Girard's paradox is an analogue of Russell's paradox which demonstrates the
inconsistency of a sufficiently rich type theory with a "type of all types." In
this talk, I will present a simplified version of the paradox due to Hurkens
(1995), which in particular has a nice analogue in naive set theory. After
treating this classical intuition and the type-theoretic argument, if we have
time we will implement the paradox in Lean. }
