\p{Transfer systems are relatively simple combinatorial objects which classify
the homotopy types of N-infty operads, an equivariant analogue of E-infty
operads. In this talk, we informally present this homotopy-theoretic story so as
to motivate the combinatorial study of saturated transfer systems, which in good
cases classify linear isometries operads. We then give a novel method for
enumerating saturated transfer systems on cylindrical modular lattices, for
instance the subgroup lattices of finite cyclic groups, and tightly characterize
the asymptotic behavior in the height of the cylinder. This talk presents joint
work with several Reed College students along with Ang√©lica Osorno and Kyle
Ormsby}
