\p{The [regular coimage](rs-00AT) of a map #{x\xto{f} y} is always a
[quotient](rs-0098), which we write #{x/\ker f}. The inuition is that the
[kernel pair](rs-002Y) is (in [\scat{Set}](rs-000C)-like settings) like the set
of pairs of elements of #{x} which agree in #{y}, and so the
[coequalizer](rs-0026) is like the set of nonempty fibers of #{f}.}
