\p{A (strong, compare to [weak](rs-00AI)) \em{factorization system} in a [category](rs-0001) #{C} consists of
two classes of maps #{L} and #{R} so that:
\ul{
  \li{every map admits an [#{(L, R)}-factorization](rs-00AF);}
  \li{this factorization is unique up to unique [isomorphism](rs-0002);}
  \li{#{L} and #{R} are closed under composition and contain the isomorphisms.}
